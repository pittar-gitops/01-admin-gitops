# If you intend to seed the Sealed Secrets controller with a known secret, uncomment the resources stanza
# and make sure your sealed secrets Secret is in this directory.
# Ensure this secret is part of your .gitignore.  You don't want to check it into source control!
#
# If you leave "sealed-secrets-secret.yaml" commented out, Sealed Secrets will still be installed into your cluster
# and a new TLS secret will be automatically generated.  You an then extract this secret to generete your own
# sealed secrets using the "kubeseal" CLI.
